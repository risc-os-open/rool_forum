# RISC OS Open Forum

This is a Rails application created via [`thredded_create_app`](https://github.com/risc-os-open/**thredded_create_app**) which creates a basic forum application based on the [Thredded](https://github.com/risc-os-open/thredded) engine.

Install via the usual for Rails 5 - `bundle install`, set up `config/database.yml` and so-on.
